All three of us met to discuss what information we wanted to obtain from MOCA (experiments, errors, etc.). 
We also discussed together which analysis to run on the data that we gatehered. 

Artidoro set up the machines on Azure/AWS/GCP and the AI2Thor environment. 
This took a long time since initially he thought we could use TIR but there were concerns with being unable to run commands as root.
He ran the evaluation of MOCA and stored additional information from the evaluation run (error analysis and IoU). 
He also wrote the second part of the introduction, the error analysis, unimodal experiemnts description, and the conclusion in the report.

Jingyuan took the evaluation results from MOCA generated by Artidoro and the ones provided by the ALFRED repository for the Seq2Seq baseline. 
He ran the analysis and produced the graphs and tables that we have in the report.

Christian worked on the report and helped in the discussions of which data to store from the MOCA baseline and which analysis to perform on the data.
