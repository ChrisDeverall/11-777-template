To reproduce the data analysis install requirements on python 3.8:

```
pip install -r requirements
```

The helper code for parsing the data is in `data_parse.py`. We use two notebooks for data anlysis: `action_space_analysis.ipynb` and `data_analysis_instructions.ipynb`. Please run the notebooks with the data folder in the same path. We used the 'lite' data for this analysis (the data that only contains the json files descriptions of the trajectory and instructions without images). For information on dowloading the data please see the original ALFRED [repository](https://github.com/askforalfred/alfred).
